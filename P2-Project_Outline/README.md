## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our project is titled DODO, short for Day out/Day off. We want to help users find a way to spend their free time without
overloading them with choices. With some simple tags, users will be able to have an itinerary built to their tastes 
in mind, including things such as resturaunts, outdoor activities, art/culture events, time available, expenditure, 
and location/distance willing to travel, as well as incorporating realtime weather updates. With these things in mind, we will build a unique schedule that takes the burden
of descision, and pushes users to be able to experience new places, events, resturaunts, etc.

### Features
Features we want to include are a user profile and login, tags to filter searches, weather and location data, and add a point
of interest feature
### Technologies
We be using Java, Springboot, MySQL for backend and JavaScript, css, Thymeleaf html, and Bulma for frontend.
### What I'll Have to Learn
Incorporating Weather and Location APIs will be something that we will need to learn, as well as learning and incorporating
the Bulma database for frontend view appeal.
